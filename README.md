# MyPT

I worked on the login page and messaging feature for the MyPT Android/iOS app I created in conjunction with Johannes McMan, Zach Larum, and Cole Wallin.  The repository for the complete app is https://github.com/hannesmcman/shootforthird.  This app was designed at the Minnehack 2018 hackathon.
