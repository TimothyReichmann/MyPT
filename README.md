# MyPT

I designed the login page and worked on formatting for the messaging feature for the MyPT Android/iOS app. This app was created in conjunction with Johannes McMan, Zach Larum, and Cole Wallin at the Minnehack 2018 hackathon. The repository for the complete app is https://github.com/hannesmcman/shootforthird.
